# local_video_transmitter
A little program that transfers a video from a "senders" camera through your local network to a specific "receiver".

OpenCV is required for image processing.
Here is an easy tutorial to install OpenCV: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-opencv-in-c-on-linux/

The "sender" need to know the IP-Address of your "receiver".
Additionally, you have to configure the IP-Address for the python "receiver" manually.
